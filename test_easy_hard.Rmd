## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library}
 library(volesti)
 library(plotly)
 library("plot3D")
```

## Including Plots

```{r 3D cube}
 P = GenCube(3, "V")
 points = sample_points(P, N=1000, WalkType = "BW", walk_step = 5)
dt=t(points)
 colnames(dt) = c("x", "y", "z")
 dt=data.frame(dt)
fig <- plot_ly(dt,type="scatter3d", x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, mode="markers",colors = c('#BF382A'))
fig
```


```{r 3D 100-facet polytope}
 P = GenRandHpoly(3, 100)
   points = sample_points(P, N=5000, WalkType = "BW", walk_step = 5)
  dt=t(points)
   colnames(dt) = c("x", "y", "z")
   dt=data.frame(dt)
   fig <- plot_ly(dt,type="scatter3d", x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, mode="markers",colors = c('#BF382A'),sizes=c(0.05, 0.05))
 fig
